Yopp
====

Have you ever spent more than 1 second wondering:

*"How do I get on my computer this photo I just made with my phone?"*

or

*"How do I get this PDF from my computer to my phone?"

Then you probably thought about:

* Let's use Dropbox! ... oh no I'm not logged in on my phone, but what is my password again?

* Well, let's send the file to myself via email!

* I should just use a USB cable... but where is my USB cable again?

You can forget about this and use Yopp instead:

Installation
----
Create a folder on your server and put the `index.php` file, that's it!

How does it work?
----

* Only **one** file will stay on the server, so each time you upload a new file, the previous file will be deleted.

* By default, the file will be deleted on server after first download.


What about security?
----

* There's no security, so everyone who has the URL can download your last file (well, not if you downloaded it, because then it will be automatically deleted on server). Why? Because sometimes you just want a quick solution for non-sensitive/personal data, rather than a super secure solution that would take 2 minutes (go to Gmail on phone, enter login, enter password, upload file, go to Gmail on computer, enter login, enter password, download the file...)

* Tip: use a random folder name (e.g. http://www.example.com/xHsy279q1/), and don't share the URL
